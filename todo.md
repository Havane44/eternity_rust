# To-do list

- change init() so that it generates a random board instead of putting the pieces in order
- compute the maximum score a puzzle can have based on the dimensions (fn maximum_score(n) -> u32)
- implement selection functions (random, tournament)
- start genetic algorithm blueprint (put the functions in order and start designing the loop, the populations, etc...)
- implement crossing function
- implement mutation function
- implement replacement function (all the population)
