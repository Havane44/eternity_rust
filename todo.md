- [x] compute the maximum score a puzzle can have based on the dimensions (fn maximum_score(n) -> u32)
- [x] start genetic algorithm scaffolding (put the functions in order and start designing the loop, the populations, etc...)
- [ ] update the Puzzle and Piece structs
- [ ] create a PuzzleFeatures struct
- [ ] implement selection functions (random, tournament)
- [ ] implement crossing function
- [ ] implement mutation function
