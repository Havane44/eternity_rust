# To-do list

- [ ] change init() so that it generates a random board instead of putting the pieces in order
- [x] compute the maximum score a puzzle can have based on the dimensions (fn maximum_score(n) -> u32)
- [x] start genetic algorithm scaffolding (put the functions in order and start designing the loop, the populations, etc...)
- [ ] implement selection functions (random, tournament)
- [ ] implement crossing function
- [ ] implement mutation function
- [ ] implement replacement function (all the population)
